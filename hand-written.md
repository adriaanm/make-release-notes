We are happy to announce the availability of Scala 2.10.6.

This maintenance release closes the Scala 2.10.x series by integrating [three pending backports](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=milestone%3A2.10.6+is%3Aclosed).
We have no plans to publish another 2.10 release.

We'd like to encourage you to upgrade to the Scala 2.11 series as soon as possible.

Scala 2.10.6 is binary compatible with previous releases in the 2.10 series.

### Scala IDE
The current release of Scala IDE supports any 2.10.x release, and is available on the [download site](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html).
